# PROG 02: Represent!

Phone
This app is called Representatives. You can either type in a valid 5 digit US zip code or choose to click the current location. When you press enter, a new screen with a list of congress people from that location will appear (This will usually be 2 Senates and 1 House of Representative). If you want a more detailed view, you just need to click on the representative\'s card to get more information including the committee they are part of and bills they have sponsored. Depending on whether the representative is Republican or Democrat his/her respective screen will be red or blue in color.  

Watch
When a valid zip code is entered on the phone. The list of representatives will also be shown on the watch. You scroll up and down to view them. If you click on a representatives name on the watch, this will take you to the detailed information page of that respective candidate on the phone. You can also press the '2012 vote view' button to see the outcome of the 2012 presidential outcome on your app. If Obama is winning in your area, the screen will be blue. If Romney is winning, the screen will be red. Lastly you can shake the watch. When you shake it, the watch will send a random zipcode back to the phone and the phone and the watch will list the corresponding representatives from that random location.
